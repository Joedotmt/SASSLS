If you are seeing this on the demo site (not on Github), I have done something wrong, oops /:

## USAGE
**As of now** THE SOURCE OF THIS PROGRAM IS NOT TO BE USED **ANYWHERE** and in **ANY WAY** without permission **(this will change to be open in a few months)**

## How it was made
SvelteKit + Pocketbase
